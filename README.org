Make duplicity use filenames that are easy to migrate to glacier.

The filenames for data archives are prefixed with =data-=,
e.g. =data-duplicity-full.20131101T150444Z.vol1.difftar.gpg= instead
of =duplicity-full.20131101T150444Z.vol1.difftar.gpg=.

This allows you to write an amazon glacier migration expression for
data files only.

* Usage

** Method 1: PATH
Set =$PATH= to this directory.

** Method 2: glacierize

Invoke =glacierize=, which will implement Method 1 for you, e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo /path/to/duplicity-glacier/glacierize duply home status
#+END_SRC

* Migrating existing s3 archives

For your convenience: =s3-rename.rb= (requires =s3-cmd=).  Will rename
data archives so that they are prefixed with =data-=.
